# Leroux_Stan

The purpose is to develop some Stan codes to implement Leroux model using Stan codes and also to create a function tht can be used in multilevel/hierarchical Bayesian model to implement Leroux at any stage of the model in Stan. 

We will see and implement existing Stan codes for fitting spatial models to small area level data and will check how Leroux mdoel can be implemented by incorporating necessary changes in the existing codes or by creating new functions.
